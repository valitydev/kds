# KDS

**K**eyring **D**istribution **S**ervice. Allows securely managing keyring and provide [CDS](https://github.com/valitydev/cds) with keyring secrets.

## Building

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
$ make compile
```

## Running

To enter the [Erlang shell][1] with the project running, run the following command:

```bash
$ make rebar-shell
```

## Development environment

### Run in a docker container

You can run any of the tasks defined in the Makefile from inside of a docker container (defined in `Dockerfile.dev`) by prefixing the task name with `wc-`. To successfully build the dev container you need `Docker BuildKit` enabled. This can be accomplished by either installing [docker-buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) locally, or exporting the `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` environment variable.

#### Example

* This command will run the `compile` task in a docker container:
```bash
$ make wc-compile
```

### Run in a docker-compose environment

Similarly, you can run any of the tasks defined in the Makefile from inside of a docker-compose environment (defined in `docker-compose.yaml`) by prefixing the task name with `wdeps-`. To successfully build the dev container you need `Docker BuildKit` enabled (see `Run in a docker container` section). It *may* also be necessary to export a `COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1` environment variable for `docker-compose` container builds to work properly.

#### Example

* This command will run the `test` task in a docker-compose environment:
```bash
$ make wdeps-test
```
